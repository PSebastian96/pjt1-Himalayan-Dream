<h2> Introduction </h2>

Welcome to my first readme file and my first website project.

This is my first milestone project, which is a simple responsive website written in HTML5 and CSS3 with added Bootstrap classes.

The projects objective is to make a front end website with HTMl and CSS, while bootstrap classes have been used to 
make the website responsive and mobile phone friendly.

Note * - * the forms on the website have no backend, therefore all the entered data (name,email) won't be stored and actual registration is not possible. *
