                               <p>Buddhism is a non-theistic system. 
                                That is to say, they do not believe in the existence of a supreme being. 
                                However, it is a way of life. And, Buddhism is beyond religion.
                                In addition, about an estimated 488 million in the world practice Buddhism. 
                                Hence, it represents up to 9% to 10% of the world’s total population.</p>
                            
                                <p>Buddhism as a philosophy exists across many cultures and periods. 
                                Also, it goes with variable teachings and practices. 
                                Despite the differences among Buddhist traditions, they still share a standard set of core beliefs.</p>
                                
                                <p>Thus, in Buddhism, the primary purpose of life is to end suffering. 
                                The Buddha teachings emphasize that humans suffer because of earthly pleasures. 
                                In the same manner, he taught that these pleasures mask the rate of human suffering. 
                                Therefore, Buddhism teaches us the importance of recognizing the impermanence of all things. 
                                And, above all, how to free oneself from such attachments.</p> 
                                <h2 id="center-text">The Buddhist Beliefs</h2>
                               <div>
                                 <ul>
                                   <li>The Four Noble Truths</li>
                                   <ol type="i"> 
                                   <li>The First Noble Truth - Life is made of suffering (Dukkha)</li>
                                   <p>Suffering can come in many forms. However, there are three distinct kinds of pain corresponding to the first three sights the Buddha. 
                                    More so, these are what the Buddha saw on his first journey outside his palace. 
                                    Thus, they include: Old age, Sickness and Death.</p>
                                    <p>Even more, according to the Buddha, the problem of suffering goes much deeper. 
                                    As a result, Life is not ideal.</p>
                                    <p>Hence, it frequently fails to come up to our expectations.</p>
                                    <p>Human beings are subject to desires and cravings. 
                                     But, even when we can satisfy these desires, the satisfaction is only temporary. 
                                     That is to say, pleasure does not last. 
                                     Or, even if it does, it becomes boring.</p>
                                     <p>However, when we are not suffering from outward causes like illness or grief, we are unfulfilled and unsatisfied. 
                                     This is the truth of suffering. Although, some people who encounter this teaching may find it doubtful. 
                                     Either way, Buddhists find it neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but realistic.</p>
                                     <p>Fortunately, the Buddha’s teachings do not end with suffering. 
                                     Instead, they go on to tell us what we can do about it and how to stop it.</p>
                                     <li>The Second Noble Truth - The causes of suffering are desire and attachment. (Samudāya)</li>
                                     <p>Our day-to-day troubles may come from the following causes: thirst, failure, pain from an injury, sadness from the loss of a loved one. 
                                      Certainly, in the second of his Noble Truths, the Buddha taught about the cause of all suffering. 
                                      And, most noteworthy, it is much more deeply rooted than our immediate worries.</p>
                                      <p>The Buddha taught that the root of all suffering is desire, tanhā.
                                      Further, this comes in three forms and can come in any of the listed names as the Buddha described:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                     <li>Three Roots of Evil</li>
                                     <p>Greed and desire and envy are the three ultimate roots of evil.</p>
                                     <li>The Three Fires</li>
                                     <p>The Three Fires are hate, greed and ignorance exhibited simultaneously.</p>
                                     <li>Three Poisons</li>
                                     <p>Ignorance or delusion, represented by a pig. Then, hatred and destructive urges, represented by a snake.</p>
                                      </ul>
                                     <li>The Third Noble Truth - Suffering can be stopped (Nirodha)</li>
                                     <p>The Buddha taught that the way to extinguish desire, which causes suffering, is to liberate oneself from attachment.</p>
                                     <p>In order to liberate oneself from attachments is by extinguishing the three fires of greed, delusion, and hatred. 
                                     Above all, the Buddha himself showed the possibility of such virtue during his lifetime.</p>
                                     <li>The Fourth Noble Truth - The way to end suffering is to follow the Noble Eightfold Path (Magga).</li>
                                     <p>The final Noble Truth is the Buddha’s prescription for the end of suffering. 
                                     This is a set of principles called the Eightfold Path.</p>
                                     </ol>
                                     <li>The Eightfold Path</li>
                                     <ol type="i">
                                     <li>Having the Right View/Understanding</li>
                                     <p>You need to know things as they indeed are without misunderstandings for all things change. 
                                     Hence, the need to develop the wisdom of how things work. On the same note, identify yourself and respect others.</p>
                                     <li>Have the Right Thinking</li>
                                     <p>Always set your life on the correct path. Similarly, make a full resolution and dedication to overcoming the urge for self-centered craving. 
                                     Certainly, one can achieve this by developing love, kindness, empathy, and compassion for others.</p>
                                     <li>Right Speech</li>
                                     <p>Abstain from lies and deceptions, backbiting, idle, and abusive speech.</p>
                                     <p>Instead, cultivate honesty and truthfulness. Also, practice speech that is kind and benevolent. 
                                      Let your words reflect your desire to help, not harm others.</p>
                                     <li>Right Conduct</li>
                                     <p>Practice selfless conduct that reflects the highest state of the life you want to live. 
                                     That is to say, express the manner that is peaceful, honest and pure showing compassion for all beings.</p>
                                     <li>Right Livelihood</li>
                                     <p>Earn a living that does not harm other living beings. 
                                     Thus, avoid work that causes suffering to others. Or, that makes a decent, virtuous life impossible. Therefore, do not engage in any occupation that opposes or distracts one from the path of love.
                                     Most of all, serve the world through your work.</p>
                                     <li>Right Effort</li>
                                     <p>Seek to make a balance in the exertion of your spiritual path. 
                                     Hence, Moderate your life, not to over-zealously do things. 
                                     Work to develop more wholesome mind states, while gently striving to go deeper and live more fully.</p>
                                     <li>Right Mindfulness</li>
                                     <p>Become intensely aware of all the states in the body, feeling, and mind. 
                                     Through meditation always examine your thoughts, speech, and action. Moreover, do not set your mind on self-centered thoughts. Instead, be aware of your thoughts, emotions, body, and world as they exist in the present moment. 
                                     Note also, your thoughts create your reality!</p>
                                     <li>Right Concentration</li>
                                     <p>Deep meditation leads to a higher state of consciousness (enlightenment). 
                                     Therefore, through the application of meditation and mental discipline, always seek to extinguish the last flame of consciousness. 
                                     Therein, develop an emptiness that has room to embrace and love all things.</p>
                                     </ol>
                                     <li>The Five Precepts</li>
                                     <p>The Five Precepts are basic ethical guidelines for the followers of Buddhism. 
                                     As a result, they are to be undertaken voluntarily. 
                                     In contrast to the idea of commandments from a god.</p>
                                     <p>According to Patimokkha (the basic code of monastic discipline), there exist over 227 rules of conduct that all Buddhist are supposed to observe. 
                                     However, the five Buddhist precepts summarize all.</p>
                                     <p>This includes:</p>
                                     <ul>
                                     <li>Abstinence from Murder</li>
                                     <li>Abstinence from Alcoholism</li>
                                     <li>Sexual Misconduct</li>
                                     <li>Abstinence from Stealing</li>
                                     <li>Refrain from evil-minded thoughts</li>
                                     </ul>
                                     <p>The above five principles are closely related. But, they are the core five ethical rules of Buddhism. One can refer to them as “Buddhist commandments.”</p>
                                     <li>Meditation</li>
                                     <p>Meditation is an essential practice of a Buddhist. 
                                     Most of all, meditation means focusing the mind on achieving an inner stillness that leads to a state of enlightenment. 
                                     More so, it is a devotional exercise. Meditation is merely the practice of focusing your attention on a particular object of practice. Or, generally something simple, like a word or phrase. Also, it is another core belief of Buddhism. Meditation is the key. 
                                     That is to say, the practice of meditation helps you attend a heightened state of awareness and focused attention.</p>
                                     <p>With meditation, you can achieve a tremendous calming effect. Surprisingly, it can make your brain age slower. 
                                     Also, meditation removes your mind from unnecessary worries. 
                                     And, it increases the life span.</p>
                                     <li>Karma</li>
                                     <p>Buddhism teaches the belief in karma. Certainly, Karma means that all actions have consequential effects. 
                                     Furthermore, the consequences of acts undertaken in earlier lifetimes will be felt immediately, or years later.</p>
                                     <p>The laws of karma are all about the positive and negative implications of our words, thoughts, and deeds. In essence, everything we do links to our karma. Thus:</p>
                                       <ul>
                                       <li>How we see our role in life</li>
                                       <li>The way we treat others</li>
                                       <li>How we develop our characters</li>
                                       <li>How we use our resources</li>

                                       <p>Indeed, it is a Buddhist aim to educate oneself through how karma works to escape the adverse effects.</p>
                                       <li>Reincarnation</li>
                                       <p>This is one of the core beliefs of Buddhism. 
                                        Hence, Reincarnation is the concept that people are reborn after dying. 
                                        In general sense, it is merely understood as living a multiple life.
                                        But, the idea of reincarnation is quite broad in Buddhism. In other words, reincarnation can also be referred to as rebirth. 
                                        However, the idea behind the two might differ to a certain extent.</p>
                                        <p>To clarify, in reincarnation, the individual may recur repeatedly. 
                                         But for rebirth, a person does not necessarily return to earth as the same entity ever again.</p>
